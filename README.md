# Electron simulation

The electron is a subatomic particle which, together with the atomic nucleus (formed of protons and neutrons) make up atoms. The exchange of electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding. This is the inspiration for our project. The robot will simulate the behaviour of an electron where throughout this project we will "train" our electron to do some of the basic functions of a real electron. That is, orbiting around an atomic nucleus and the transition of the electron from one nucleus to another.

The way we have proposed the project is as follows: we will start by implementing basic functions and we will be building on top of it to finally have implemented the functionalities described in the previous paragraph. It will be divided into two parts, the first one will consist of the implementation of behaviors through non-recurring artificial neural networks. The second part will be an extension of the final behavior to a recurrent artificial neural network.
